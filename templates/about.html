	<h1>About</h1>
	<h2>To whose benefit?</h2>
	<p>WhoPaid is a <a href="http://www.rhok.org/">Random Hacks of Kindness</a> project that grew beyond the scope of the weekend hackathon.
	The team behind the app agreed to continue working on the project, to bring more transparency into politics.</p>
	<p>When you use WhoPaid on your Android* device, you can listen to a political ad, submit the recording, and receive journalistic content
	and facts about the ad and its funders (#whopaid).</p>
	<p>Our open-source code is on <a href="https://github.com/cuibono">github</a>.
	<p class="footnote">*iOS/iPhone app coming soon.</p>
